      <p>You push the boat out into the sea and hop in. The
        waves are quite a bit bigger than they looked from
        the beach.<p>
      <p>The tide pulls you out to sea, and you notice
        that there's a hole in the bottom of the boat!<p>
      <p>What do you want to do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to paddle back to shore</li>
        <li>Jump into the sea and try to swim back</li>
        <li>Block the hole with something</li>
